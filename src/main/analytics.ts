 * upstream project. Builders Bot does not control that service, so phase 0 of
 * `.buildersbot-build/bug-reports/DESIGN.md` removed the client and the transport. Builders Bot has no
 * diagnostics service of its own yet. Each method keeps its signature, so the callers do not change,
 * and does nothing: no event, report or identity leaves the computer or goes to a file.
 * `scripts/telemetry-destination-guard.ts` stops a merge that brings the upstream client back.
