/**
 * Where the app listens for the Chrome host, computed the way the host computes it
 * (`native/chrome-host/main.swift`, `socketPath`), never from a setting that an agent could change:
 *
 * - store and dev: `~/Library/Application Support/Builders Bot/cb/b.sock` (`b-dev.sock` for dev);
 * - e2e: `<per-user temporary folder>/bb-e2e/b-e2e.sock`, so a test never writes in the app's folder;
 * - a path above 103 bytes (the `sun_path` of macOS holds 104 with its terminator) moves to
 *   `<per-user temporary folder>/bb/`. That folder (`confstr(_CS_DARWIN_USER_TEMP_DIR)`) belongs to the
 *   user and only the user can enter it. Never `/tmp`.
 *
 * The folder must be a real folder of this user that no one else can enter (mode 0700). The app makes
 * it so when it creates it, and refuses to listen in one that is not.
