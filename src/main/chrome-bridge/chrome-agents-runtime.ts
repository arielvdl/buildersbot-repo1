/**
 * The person's Chrome for the agents, in the app (DESIGN §10.1): the `ChromeBridgeService` (socket,
 * peer check, pairing, sealed state) and the `ChromeTabsHost` that answers `buildersbot_chrome`.
 *
 * - Nothing starts while web access is not "chrome": no socket, no file, no addon load. The extension
 *   is the default; Playwright is the person's choice in Settings.
 * - The keys and the bridge state are sealed by `safeStorage` (the macOS Keychain). Without it the
 *   bridge does not start.
 * - The manifest is written at each start in Chrome mode and by "Connect Chrome" (the Settings switch
 *   turned on); a build that is not packaged never writes into a real browser's folder unless the
 *   owner sets `BUILDERSBOT_CHROME_BRIDGE_REAL_CHROME=1` (`native-host-manifests.ts`).
 * - The pairing card is a native dialog of the app: the words that Chrome must show, and three
 *   options, with the right one at a random place. Nothing is typed.
 * - An installed app takes its channel from its own signature (`packagedSigning`): the team's Developer
 *   ID is `store`; the owner's own certificate (`scripts/sign-local-macos.sh`) is `local`, with a host
 *   signed by the same certificate. An app with an ad-hoc signature has no host it can check, and the
 *   bridge stays off. A development run is `dev`.
