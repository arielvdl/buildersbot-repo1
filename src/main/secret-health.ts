// Which encrypted files of this computer cannot be decrypted now (voice-anywhere design, section 3.2).
//
// Every encrypted file in the application data folder uses the same system cipher. When the keychain
// item of the app changes, or a profile is copied from another app, all of them become unreadable at
// once. Each store reports this in its own place, if at all; this registry lets Settings › General
// list them together.
//
// It holds only the store, the file name and a function that reads the state now, never a value. The
// state is read at each call, so a key that the user saves again leaves the list at once.
