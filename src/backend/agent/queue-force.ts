 * Forces one queued message into the conversation: it stops the turn that holds the agent's own chat,
 * as the Stop button does, and starts the message next, alone, before the other queued messages.
 *
 * The order of the steps is the safety. A start that is on its way ends first, so that the turn it
 * starts can be read. The message goes to the head of the queue before the Stop is sent, so the drain
 * that the end of the stopped turn schedules starts it, whenever that end comes. A turn that ended by
 * itself before the Stop leaves the message at the head, and the drain starts it once. A Stop that
 * fails puts the queue back as it was. A second force of the same message waits for the first one and
 * gets its answer, so one click sends one Stop.
 *
 * No Stop is sent when the message cannot start after it: channel or messaging work waits first in the
 * agent's chat, or the chat is held, for example by a compaction or by a task turn on a provider that
 * runs one turn at a time. The message then waits at the head of the queue, and the answer is `next`.
