 * only when both caps have room, so the cap that is reached first holds it. When the slots are full, the
 * waiting lanes go by the head of their queue: a message from a person first, then routine runs and
 * teammate messages, and the oldest first in each group. A delivery that waits stays queued. It never imports the service.
 *
 * With `personPlace` on, the cap on agents has one place more for a lane whose head is a message of the
 * person: a person who writes while routines fill the cap does not wait for one of them to end. Only
 * one such place exists, and the oldest message of the person takes it first. The other lanes still
 * see the cap as the person set it.
 *
 * No slot waits on another slot: a teammate request ends the turn that sends it, and the answer
 * arrives as a new delivery.
