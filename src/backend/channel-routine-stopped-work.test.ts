// Stopped work of a channel routine that stayed stopped for ever. The owner's load panel listed 253
// stopped runs: 247 were the hourly request of one routine, posted again as a new task at each start
// of the app (the receipt of the request was pruned with the older channel events), and a deleted
// routine left each stopped task it had posted. These tests drive the real channel service and
// routine scheduler on a database of their own.
