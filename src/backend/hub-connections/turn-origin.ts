// Where a turn came from, for the Hub connections (docs/architecture/hub-connections.md, "Who may

// of the person that made it, so a turn that may not spend cannot start a turn that may.

/**
 * Where the turn that calls the tool came from. Only the person at this computer (`owner_ui`), the
 * person's routines and the person's agents get the tools. A chat app thread, a channel and a team
 * member never do: they would spend the person's money, and they are a direct path for injection.
 * `unknown` is a turn whose origin the app cannot prove; it never gets the tools.
 *
 * `routine_agent` is an agent turn that a routine started, at any distance: a message that a routine's
 * turn sent, or a run of a routine that an agent or a routine saved (a webhook routine too). For the Hub
 * connections it is `agent` (`hubConnectionOrigin`). It stays on every message that such a turn sends,
 * so the owner's Chrome, which no routine may use, stays closed along the whole chain.
