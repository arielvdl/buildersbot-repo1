// The two tools that every agent reaches the Hub connections through. They are deferred tools: an
// agent finds them with `tool_search` and runs them with `tool_call`, so no provider gets a new direct
// tool, and a vendor's own tools never reach an agent. The texts are Builders Bot's own, in English
// like the rest of the agent prompt, and carry no vendor text (docs/architecture/hub-connections.md).
