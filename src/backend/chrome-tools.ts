/**
 * `buildersbot_chrome`: the browser tools on the tabs of the person's own Chrome, through the Builders Bot
 * extension (DESIGN §10.2). The definitions are those of `buildersbot_browser`, with descriptions of their
 * own, so an agent reads one schema and gets one result format in either browser. `buildersbot_browser`
 * keeps the Builders Bot browser, with the Vault, persistent sessions and takeover from the phone.
 *
 * The namespace exists for an agent only while web access is "chrome" and its turn may use the
 * owner's Chrome; the router grants it per call. Tools that need what this release does not carry to
 * Chrome yet (upload by content, the secret handoff, the card fill, the takeover card, recording, the
 * environment and the agent's own scripts) are not in it.
