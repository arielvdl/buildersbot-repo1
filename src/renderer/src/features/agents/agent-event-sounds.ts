 * Plays one sound for an agent event that the user must know about: a question of the Guard, a
 * question or an approval that waits for the user, and a run that fails. A finished reply has its own
 * completion sound, so it plays nothing here. Desktop and the web client give the returned function
 * each event of the selected server. `notifies` gives the mute of each agent, so a muted agent stays
 * silent, as with the completion sound. `nameOf` names the agent for Recent sounds.
