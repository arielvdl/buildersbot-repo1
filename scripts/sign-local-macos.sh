#!/bin/zsh
# Signs a local macOS build with the self-signed "Builder Studio Local Signing"
# identity so macOS keeps the Accessibility and Screen Recording grants across
# rebuilds.
#
# Why this exists: `bun run package` passes `--config.mac.identity=null`, so
# electron-builder leaves the app ad-hoc signed. An ad-hoc signature has no
# stable designated requirement — TCC records the cdhash, every rebuild changes
# it, and the user has to grant Computer Use again (the toggle stays on and the
# app stops appearing in the panes). A certificate gives the app the requirement
# `identifier "app.buildersbot.desktop" and certificate leaf = H"…"`, which a
# rebuild signed with the same certificate still satisfies.
#
# The Computer Use driver (`Contents/Resources/cua-driver`) keeps its own
# Developer ID signature from Cua AI: re-signing it would drop the
# `com.apple.security.automation.apple-events` entitlement it needs.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/sign-local-macos.sh [path/to/Builders Bot.app]
#   ./scripts/sign-local-macos.sh --install   # also install into /Applications
#
# With no argument the app is taken from dist/mac-arm64 or dist/mac.
