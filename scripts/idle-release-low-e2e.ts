// Checks the switch `idle-release-low` of the advanced optimizations (beta): when the memory of the Mac
// goes from `ok` to `low`, the provider threads with no turn for more than 2 minutes close. Runs the real
// memory reading (`MacMemory`, with samples that the test gives), the real queue clause (`MemoryHold`),
// a real switch file (`OptimizationStore`) and the real pool of provider threads (`IdleThreadPool`).
//   1. Switch off: `low` closes nothing, and `critical` closes every idle thread, as before.
//   2. Switch on: `ok` to `low` closes the threads idle for 2 minutes or more, once; `critical` still
//      closes every idle thread; a second sample at `low` closes nothing more.
//   3. The pool closes only the threads idle for at least the time asked, never one in a turn, and every
//      idle thread when no time is asked.
// No provider, account or network is used. `bun scripts/idle-release-low-e2e.ts`. It writes
// .buildersbot-build/idle-release-low-e2e/report.json and exits non-zero on a failure.
