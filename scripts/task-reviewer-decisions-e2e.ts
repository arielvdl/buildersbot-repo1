// Checks what the task reviewer ("Fiscal") and "Resume by itself" decide about stopped and parked work,
// on the real channel service, database and `WorkControl` of the app, with a clock that the check moves.
// The provider is a silent fake: it sends no event, as a Codex turn that hangs. Nothing starts a real
// agent, account or network.
//
// On 1 November 2026 the owner saw a stopped card for more than 15 minutes and asked whether the reviewer
// works. The installed app showed that the timer looks every minute, but:
//   - the reviewer waited 30 minutes (the interval of "Resume by itself") before it tried a failed start
//     again, although its own threshold was 5 minutes;
//   - "Resume by itself" read only the first 50 stopped rows, and resumed requests that the lead could not
//     route ("routing context limit"), which stop again in the same way, three each minute;
//   - their lines went to stdout only, so no file showed that they looked.
//
// Cases:
//   1. A run with no sign of life for 2 × N: the reviewer resumes it at 2 × N, not before.
//   2. A stopped request that the lead could not route, with no agent: no resume, "needs you" at once.
//   3. A stopped task whose agent cannot take it, with another agent of the same model: it goes to that
//      agent after the interval, with no resume first.
//   4. A start that fails twice: the reviewer resumes it at N, then gives it to another agent at 2 × N.
//   5. Low memory: a parked request waits (held: memory); a failed start is still tried.
//   6. 60 stopped rows that a resume cannot fix, then a stopped task in a later channel: it is resumed.
//   7. The last actions of the reviewer stay in their file, and the log names actions, never the text.
//   8. A start that keeps failing: the reviewer follows the task to the agents it gave it to, by turns
//      (resume, reassign, …) at N, 2 × N, 4 × N, then each interval, and stops after 6 actions: "needs you".
//   9. While the app tries a start again (`retrying`), the reviewer and "Resume by itself" leave it alone,
//      and its clock stops; after the tries end, the reviewer acts at N.
// `bun scripts/task-reviewer-decisions-e2e.ts`. Writes .buildersbot-build/task-reviewer-decisions-e2e/report.json
// and exits non-zero on a failure.
