// The system dictation of macOS, built as a tiny background application in the voice folder the
// app reads at run time:
// `.buildersbot-build/voice/os-speech/darwin/Builders Bot Dictation.app`.
//
// It is an application and not a plain binary because the speech recognition permission belongs to
// a bundle: opened with `open`, macOS attributes it to this app, whose Info.plist carries the usage
// sentence and `LSUIElement`. A plain child process of the app aborts in TCC.
//
// The bundle is signed ad hoc here and re-signed with the app when electron-builder packs it.
//
// The Windows engine needs no build: it runs a PowerShell script that main carries as text.
