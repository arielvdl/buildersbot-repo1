# The feed page

The feed shows what each run of each agent does, on every server that the app is joined to, as it
happens. The **Feed** button of the page rail opens it (`app.rail.feed`, the Lucide `Activity` mark).
It is a page, not a dialog. It is one timeline, the newest run at the bottom, as in a conversation.
Each run is one card that changes in place. A card shows the agent, its project (the sidebar section),
the title of the task or the channel, the state, the step that it does now, and what it waits for.
"Open conversation" (or "Open channel") opens the place of the run.

Step 1 of the feed is the read-only timeline. Step 2 adds the actions on the card: approve, deny,
answer, stop, resume and reassign, also on many stopped tasks at once (see [Actions](#actions)). The
feed of a joined server with the data of its host is step 3.

## The contract

`packages/contracts/src/ipc-feed.ts` holds `FeedItem` version 1, `FeedSnapshot`, `FeedDelta` and
their guards. A new field is always optional. A change that removes a field, makes one required or
changes what one means is version 2, with a new decoder; the version 1 decoder stays.

| State | When |
| --- | --- |
| `working` | A turn runs. |
| `waiting` | Messages wait in the queue of the agent, or the agent waits for something. |
| `needs-you` | An approval or a question waits for the person. |
| `stopped` | A channel task stopped with a reason, a plan limit, the task reviewer, or a turn that was stopped before its end. |
| `done` | The run ended. |
| `failed` | The run ended with an error. |

A card id is stable for its run: `<server>:t:<agent>:<thread>` for a chat or a side thread,
`<server>:task:<task>` for a stopped channel task, `<server>:q:<agent>` for the queue of an agent
that does not run. A new turn of a chat whose card ended starts that card again at the end of the
timeline. A turn that continues the same request (`continues`) keeps the card and its steps.

The IPC group is `feed` (`window.buildersbot.feed`):

| Endpoint | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `getSnapshot` | Every card (at most 5,000), in timeline order, with the cursor of the last delta. |
| `setWatching` | The window shows the page, or stops to show it. Main sends deltas only to a window that watches. |
| `delta` (event) | The cards that changed and the ids of the removed cards. The cursor goes up by one at each delta. |
| `act` | An action of the person on cards, with ids only (`FeedActionInput` version 1). It answers which cards were done and why the others were not (`FeedActionResult`). |

The handlers (`src/main/ipc/feed-handlers.ts`) accept only the main window and the chat windows: the
Dynamic Island and the browser dock overlay share the origin of the app and are refused before the
payload is read. The preload (`src/preload/feed-decoding.ts`) copies each card field by field, drops
a card that is not a version 1 card, refuses a snapshot or a delta of another version, and drops an
invalid delta instead of throwing it into the page.

## The main process

`src/main/feed/feed-aggregator.ts` builds the cards. It is plain TypeScript, with no Electron and no
file access. `src/main/feed/feed-service.ts` adds the batch timer, the windows and the reads of the
load. `forwardAgentEvent` (`src/main/renderer-forwarders.ts`) gives every agent event of every server
to `FeedService.ingest`, before any window check, so the cards stay current while no window is open.

| Source | What it gives the card |
| --- | --- |
| `turn-started`, `turn-progress`, `turn-completed` | The run, its steps (`turn-progress` is a summary already) and its end. A quiet routine run that ends leaves the feed. |
| `approval`, `prompt`, `agent-input-resolved` | "Needs you". An approval shows its kind and the program name of a command (`git`), never the command. A prompt shows its first question, cleaned, redacted and clipped. |
| `error`, `usage-limit-reached`, `queue-changed`, `waits-changed` | A failed run, a plan limit, the queue card of an agent that does not run. |
| `agent-tasks-changed`, `agents-changed`, `sidebar-layout-changed`, `runtime-snapshot` | Task titles, agent names, projects, and the runs and requests of a server when it connects. |
| `WorkControl.overview()` | This computer only, every 5 s while a window watches: the channel and tab of a running channel turn, the task reviewer's "slow" or "stalled", and the stopped channel tasks with their reason. |

The aggregator does not read `conversation`, `conversation-delta`, `conversation-page`,
`agent-task-conversation*` or the browser events: they hold the text of a conversation. It does not
show the request text of a channel task either: the title of a channel card is the channel and tab
name.

### Secrets

Every text goes through one function before it gets into a card: the internal citations are removed,
the control and format characters become spaces, the text is redacted, and then it is clipped (200
characters for a step or a reason, 140 for a title, 120 for a label). The redaction is
`redactMcpValues` with the secret values of the MCP servers of this computer, and `redactText` of
`@buildersbot/logging`, which masks the registered secrets and the token patterns (`sk-`, `ghp_`, `xox`,
`AKIA`, JWT and the others there). The text is redacted before it is clipped, so a clip cannot cut a
secret into a piece that the patterns do not find.

### Batches, memory and cost

- A change marks its card. A delta goes out at most every 100 ms: at most 10 deltas each second, each
  card at most once in a delta, at most 200 cards in a delta. The rest go in the next delta.
- While no window watches, the aggregator keeps its cards and sends nothing. A window that starts to
  watch reads the snapshot.
- At most 5,000 cards. Over the limit, the oldest ended card (`done`, `failed`) goes first, then the
  oldest card of any state. An ended run leaves after 24 hours. A card keeps its last 20 steps.
- Nothing is written to disk. After a restart, the feed starts from the runs and requests that each
  server reports (`runtime-snapshot`) and from the load of this computer; the ended runs and the steps
  before the restart are gone.

`scripts/feed-aggregator-e2e.ts` measures it with the real agent service and a stand-in Claude CLI.
Its report is `.buildersbot-build/feed-aggregator-e2e/report.json`.

## The window

The page is a host pane of `usage-context` (`view: "feed"`), so it covers the conversation as the
Schedule and Workflows pages do (`windowPageKind` is `titled`). The shared components are in
`packages/ui/src/features/feed/`, with props only:

| File | Part |
| --- | --- |
| `FeedPage.tsx` | The page: the tables, the filters, the jump bar and the timeline. |
| `FeedTables.tsx` | The tables at the top: one for each project with an agent at work. |
| `feed-tables-model.ts` | The DOM-free model of the tables (see [The tables](#the-tables)). |
| `FeedFilters.tsx` | Search (`/` goes to it), project, agent, state, and the grouping: timeline, by project, by agent. |
| `FeedJumpBar.tsx` | Live or paused, and the counters "Needs you", "Stopped", "Working": each click goes to the next such card. |
| `FeedTimeline.tsx` | The timeline, on `createChatVirtualizer`: only the cards on screen are in the DOM. |
| `FeedItemCard.tsx` | One card. |
| `FeedCardActions.tsx` | The actions of a card: the buttons, the answer, the second step, the wait and the notice. |
| `FeedBulkBar.tsx` | The selection of stopped tasks: resume them, or give them to one agent. |
| `feed-actions-controller.ts` | The state of the actions: the change at once, the way back, the selection, the keys. |
| `feed-actions-view.ts` | The DOM-free part of the actions: the card as it shows while its action runs, the labels. |
| `feed-view.ts` | The DOM-free projection: filters, rows, counters. |

The adapter is `src/renderer/src/features/feed/`: `stores/feed-store.ts` keeps one record of cards
by id and the ids in timeline order, applies the deltas in cursor order, and reads the snapshot again
after a gap. It stops watching while the window is hidden. `WorkspaceFeed.tsx` gives each card the face of
its agent, from the agents of the active server; an agent of another server has no entry and its card
uses the agent id as the seed. `feed-open.ts` opens a card: its channel, or the chat
of its agent on the tab of its side thread. A card of another server switches to that server first.

Scrolling up pauses the timeline: new cards are counted ("3 new") and do not move the reader. The
button at the bottom goes back to the newest card. The timeline is an ARIA `feed`: each card is an
`article` with `aria-posinset` and `aria-setsize`; the arrow keys, Page Up, Page Down, Home and End
move between the cards. A polite live region says when more runs need the person, not each step.

`src/renderer/stories/Feed.stories.tsx` shows the page with the preview mock
(`src/renderer/src/preview/mock-feed.ts`): empty, a normal day, 5,000 cards, new runs on a timer, and
one card of each action (`Actions`), on both palettes. The mock answers `act` with the checks of main
after 0.6 s, and refuses every action on one card. `scripts/feed-ui-e2e.ts` and
`scripts/feed-actions-ui-e2e.ts` check them in a headless browser.

## The tables

The top of the page has one table for each project that has an agent at work. A project is the sidebar
section of the agent (`FeedItem.projectId`); the agents of no section sit at one table, "No project".
The table is the one of the agent stage of a channel, in a smaller size, and the two share the kit in
`packages/ui/src/features/stage/` (geometry, table, agent, links, motion, one size observer) and its
stylesheet `agent-stage.css`. A feed table has no speech bubble and no request card: the cards below
say the step, and the label under the table says the project, the newest title ("Now: ...") and how
many runs work or need the person.

- **Who sits.** An agent with a card that works or needs the person, or whose card ended in the last
  2.8 s (3 s when it failed). The model reads the state and `endedAt` of the card itself and keeps no
  state of any card, so a feed that opens on old work shows nothing and no map of the cards grows.
  A queued or stopped run has no seat. An agent with several cards sits once, in its most urgent state.
- **What it does.** `stageActivityOfLine(step)` gives reading, thinking, editing, running or
  delegating from the last step, with "thinking" before any step. A card that needs the person is
  "waiting for you".
- **Limits.** At most 6 tables, 4 seats at each, 16 agents in all. The rest are counted in a "+N" chip.
  The most urgent table comes first, then the one with the newest card.
- **Cost.** The model sweeps the cards at each delta, and the page draws again only when what the tables
  show has changed (`sameFeedTables`). One timer, for the next run that leaves its table; none while no
  run waits to leave. A table that is off screen, or a hidden window, pauses its loops with one
  attribute. With nobody at work the top is a 40 px strip: no observer, no timer, no animation.
- **Filters.** The name of a project filters the feed by it, and a cube filters it by that agent; the
  same click clears it. The table itself is only a picture. "Fold the tables" keeps the choice on this
  computer (`buildersbot:feed-tables:v1`, `src/renderer/src/features/feed/feed-tables-storage.ts`).
- **Not in the tables yet.** The link and the flying cube between a delegating agent and the agent that
  gets the work need the card to say who delegated (`FeedItem.delegatedBy`, a field main does not send).
  The agent of a joined server shows with the default colour and no model chip: the card has neither.

## Actions

The window sends ids only: the card, and the request of an approval or a question. Main never takes a
command, a path, an agent of a request or a channel from the window. `src/main/feed/feed-actions.ts`
(`FeedActions`, no Electron) reads the card as main holds it now and checks again:

| Check | Refusal |
| --- | --- |
| The card exists. | `gone` |
| The card is of this computer. A card of a joined server offers only `open`. | `remote` |
| The request that the window names is the one that the card waits for now (same id, same type). | `stale` |
| The attention registry still has the request open, for the agent and the thread of the card (`AgentService.pendingRequest`). A provider can use a request id again. | `stale` |
| The card offers the action (`FeedItem.actions`, set by the aggregator with the same rules). | `not-allowed` |
| A `high` risk approval came with `confirmed: true`. The risk is read from the live request, not from the window. | `unconfirmed` |
| The same action on the same request, or on the same run, is not running and was not done. | `duplicate` |
| For a reassign, the agent is one that the card offers. | `not-member` |

Then it calls the operation that the conversation or the load panel calls. There is no other path
to a decision:

| Action | Operation |
| --- | --- |
| `approve`, `deny` | `AgentService.respondToApproval`, as the local `agent:respond-to-approval` handler |
| `answer` | `AgentService.respondToPrompt`, as the local `agent:respond-to-prompt` handler |
| `stop` | `WorkControl.stopWork`, the Stop of the load panel: a channel run through its channel, a chat turn through `interrupt` |
| `resume`, `reassign` | `WorkControl.bulkStopped`, the action of the stopped work page of Settings. A resume of a task that stopped because an outside step may already have happened gives the new turn the note of what was done. |

After a stop, a resume or a reassign, main reads the load again, so the cards follow at once. The log
of a failed action has the action name and the error name only, never a text of the person.

The aggregator sets, for each card of this computer:

- `approve` and `deny` on an approval. A question of the Guard, a permissions approval and a file
  change are `risk: "high"`; the card shows the reason (cleaned, redacted, clipped) and, for a
  permissions approval, what it asks for without a path (`access`).
- `answer` on a question that a card can answer itself (`form`): one question, not secret, one
  answer, at most `FEED_CHOICE_LIMIT` choices, and no id or choice that the redaction changes. The
  window sends the index of a choice or a typed answer; main takes the label from the live request.
- `stop` on a run that works or waits for the person.
- `resume`, and `reassign` with the agents that can take the task (`reassignTo`), on a stopped
  channel task.

On the page (`FeedCardActions.tsx`, `FeedBulkBar.tsx`, `feed-actions-controller.ts`):

- The card changes at once: an answered approval or question leaves the card, and the card says
  "Approving…" or the like. Main's next delta of the card replaces this. A refusal takes the card
  back as it was and says why, on the card and in the polite live region.
- A `high` risk approval, a stop, and a denial asked with N wait for a second step: a confirmation on
  the card takes the focus. Enter confirms, Escape cancels. A second A does not confirm.
- J and K move between the cards, as the arrow keys do. A, N and R act only when the card itself has
  the focus, not a field or a button in it.
- The stopped cards have a check box. The bar above the timeline selects the stopped cards that the
  filters show, and resumes them or gives them to one agent, at most `FEED_BULK_LIMIT` in one call.

`scripts/feed-actions-e2e.ts` checks the actions with the real agent service, the real `WorkControl`
and a stand-in Codex app-server: approve (also twice at the same time), deny, a forged, crossed,
retyped, remote and old card, the confirmation of a high risk approval, the answers, stop, the resume
with the note of what was done, a bulk resume and a reassign. Its report is
`.buildersbot-build/feed-actions-e2e/report.json`. `scripts/feed-actions-ui-e2e.ts` checks the cards, the
keys, the change at once and the way back in the `Actions` stories, in a headless browser.

## Joined servers

The feed of a joined server is made only from the agent events that this app gets from that server
today, on the path that the sidebar and the Dynamic Island use. The host decides which events a
member gets, so the feed shows no run that the member cannot already see, and no new data leaves the
host. No Team API route or capability is added. The stopped channel tasks, the waits and the task
reviewer are local only, so a joined server shows none of them. A feed with the data of the host
(`feed-v1`, filtered by the role of the member) is step 3 and is off. A card of a joined server
offers no action: its conversation answers it, and the host decides who may.

## Known limits

- The title of a chat is "Chat with <agent>": `turn-started` has no title, and the feed does not read
  the conversation. Side threads take the title of their task.
- There is no cost for each run: no event carries it.
- A delta sends the whole card, with its last 20 steps. In the E2E burst, a card was about 1.8 KB.
- A chat turn that was stopped, a plan limit and a failed chat turn have no resume on the card: only
  stopped channel tasks have one, as in the load panel. The conversation sends a new message.
- A card does not show the whole command of an approval. "Open conversation" shows it.
