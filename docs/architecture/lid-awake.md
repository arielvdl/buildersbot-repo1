# Keep the Mac on with the lid closed

Settings › General has two separate settings for sleep.

| Setting | What it stops | What it does not stop |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Keep this computer awake** (`keep-awake.ts`) | Idle sleep. It holds `powerSaveBlocker.start("prevent-app-suspension")`, which is `PreventUserIdleSystemSleep`. | Sleep when the lid closes, sleep from the Apple menu, and sleep at low battery. Apple documents this in `IOPMLib.h`. |
| **With the lid closed** (`lid-awake-service.ts`) | Sleep when the lid closes, as the table below says. While it is active, also idle sleep and sleep from the Apple menu (only the display turns off), with the lid open too. | Nothing in the `battery` mode, except the stops of the safety rules. |

macOS decides the lid sleep in `IOPMrootDomain::shouldSleepOnClamshellClosed` (xnu). That function
does not read power assertions. Only an assertion with a private Apple entitlement, an external
display on the power adapter, or `pmset disablesleep 1` changes the decision. The `ioreg` key
`AppleClamshellCausesSleep = Yes` shows the normal state.

## Modes

The mode is off by default. A Mac with no `AppleClamshellState` in `IOPMrootDomain`, such as a Mac
mini, does not show it. Windows, Linux, a server and the local server process do not offer it.

| Mode | How | Needs | Limits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `off` | Nothing. | | |
| `plugged` | `/usr/bin/caffeinate -i -s -w <app pid>`. `-s` holds `PreventSystemSleep`. | No password. | macOS obeys `PreventSystemSleep` only on the power adapter. When the lid closes, macOS starts to sleep and stops in dark wake: the processor and the network stay on, the display and the GPU stay off. |
| `battery` | The `plugged` assertion, and the root safety service runs `pmset -a disablesleep 1` while the app keeps a grant fresh. | The administrator password, one time, to install the service. | `disablesleep` also stops the sleep at low battery, the sleep for heat, and the lid sleep with the lid already closed. The safety rules below replace those stops. |

The hold must be in place before the lid closes, because macOS decides the lid sleep when the lid
closes. So an active mode holds with the lid open too: `-s` on the power adapter, and
`disablesleep 1` in the `battery` mode, stop idle sleep and the sleep from the Apple menu. Settings
says this in the warning of the mode. The effect of the Apple menu is an inference from xnu, not
verified on a device.

`caffeinate -w` ends when the app process ends, also after a crash. powerd also releases the
assertions of a process that ended. So the `plugged` mode cannot stay on after the app.

`PreventSystemSleep` is marked "deprecated" in `IOPMLib.h`, but powerd obeys it on macOS 26. A
macOS update can change this. The test with the lid closed (below) shows the change.

## Safety rules

`decideLidAwake` in `lid-awake-policy.ts` applies the rules in this order. Each rule fails closed.

1. Thermal state `serious` or `critical` (Electron `powerMonitor`): stop.
2. The time limit (1, 4 or 8 hours, or no limit) with the lid closed: stop. On battery, the
   `battery` mode stops after 8 hours also with no limit, because the service stops then.
3. `plugged`, or `battery` with no installed service: hold only on the power adapter.
4. `battery`: stop below the floor (20, 30 or 50 percent), and stop when the level is not known.
   This applies on the power adapter too, except while `pmset -g batt` shows `charging`, `charged`
   or `finishing charge`. macOS can stop the charge (`AC attached; not charging`) for heat or with a
   weak adapter, and `disablesleep 1` also stops the sleep at low battery.

5. `battery` with the service: the state is `active-battery` only when `ioreg` shows
   `SleepDisabled = Yes`, or in the first 25 seconds of a new grant (the service checks each 15
   seconds). Else the service refused, for example because of heat that only it sees, or because
   the app does not run from `/Applications`. Then the state is `active-plugged` on the power
   adapter (the assertion still holds) and `paused-helper-not-confirmed` on battery. The grant stays,
   so the service can still accept. `holdsThroughLidClose` is true only for `active-plugged`, and
   for `active-battery` with `SleepDisabled = Yes`.

A stop from rule 1, 2 or 4 while the mode was active shows a desktop notification. The app reads
`pmset -g batt` and `ioreg` each 30 seconds while the mode is on, and at each power or thermal event.

### Sleep after a stop with the lid closed

With `disablesleep 1`, macOS refuses the lid sleep: `IOPMrootDomain::privateSleepSystem` returns
`kIOReturnNotPermitted` while `userDisabledAllSleep` is set (`checkSystemSleepAllowed`). When
`disablesleep` goes back to 0, `kPowerEventUserDisabledSleep` only sets the flag again. Nothing asks
for the lid sleep again, and the Mac stays on with the lid closed. So:

- After a stop from rule 1, 2 or 4 with the lid closed, the app reads `ioreg` each 2 seconds, for
  up to 30 seconds. When it shows `SleepDisabled = No`, `AppleClamshellState = Yes` and
  `AppleClamshellCausesSleep = Yes`, the app runs `pmset sleepnow`, which needs no administrator.
- The service does the same each time it turns sleep on (see below).

`AppleClamshellCausesSleep = No` (an external display on the power adapter) and an open lid never
cause a sleep request. This comes from the xnu source; it is not verified on a device.

## Root safety service

The `battery` mode needs root, because only root can set `disablesleep`. The app has an ad hoc
signature (no Team ID), so `SMAppService` cannot register a daemon. The app installs one with
`osascript ... with administrator privileges`, and macOS asks for the password.

| Path | Owner | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/Library/LaunchDaemons/app.buildersbot.lid-awake.plist` | root | `RunAtLoad`, `KeepAlive`. |
| `/Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/app.buildersbot.lid-awake.sh` | root | The service script. |
| `/Library/Application Support/BuildersBot/LidAwake/owner` | root | The uid of the user at the console during the install. |
| `/Library/Application Support/BuildersBot/LidAwake/grant/` | that user, `0700` | The grant files. |

The scripts are constants in `lid-awake-helper.ts`. The install script writes the service script and
the property list from base64 constants, so no file that a user can change goes into a root folder.
The renderer can start only the fixed install and remove actions; it gives no text to a root shell.
The password prompt text is an argument of the AppleScript `run` handler, so AppleScript reads it as
text.

The service script runs a check each 15 seconds. It turns `disablesleep` on only when all of these
are true, and off in all other cases:

- A file `grant/active-<floor>` is owned by the uid in `owner`, and its change time is less than 90
  seconds old. The app renews it each 30 seconds while the `battery` mode is active. The service
  reads only the owner and the change time, never the content.
- A process of that uid has the path `/Applications/Builders Bot.app/Contents/MacOS/Builders Bot`
  (`ps -o comm`).
- The battery charges or is full on the power adapter, or the battery is at or above the floor in
  the file name. The service never accepts a floor below 20.
- `notifyutil -g com.apple.system.thermalpressurelevel` shows exactly level 0 or 1. Apple silicon
  reports heat only here: `pmset -g therm` shows no level on this hardware. `pmset -g therm` must
  also show no thermal warning (Intel).
- On battery, the lid is closed for less than 8 hours. The service keeps the time in the root file
  `closed-since` and removes it when the lid is open.
- `ioreg` answered. A failed read turns sleep on.

When the service turns sleep on, it waits until `ioreg` shows `SleepDisabled = No`. Then, with the
lid closed and `AppleClamshellCausesSleep = Yes`, it runs `pmset sleepnow` (see "Sleep after a stop
with the lid closed"). It does not do this on `SIGTERM`, which comes at shut down, restart and
removal.

At its start the service turns `disablesleep` off, because `pmset` writes the setting to disk and
keeps it after a restart. On `SIGTERM` it turns it off too. So after a crash of the app or a quit,
normal sleep comes back in 90 to 105 seconds, about 2 minutes. After a restart, it comes back when
launchd starts the service. The service touches the root file `alive` at each check. When the app
is not in `/Applications` for 8 checks (2 minutes), the service turns sleep on, removes its files
and runs `launchctl bootout` for itself.

The app shows the service as `installed` only when the files match and `alive` changed in the last
45 seconds, or the Mac woke in the last 45 seconds (`kern.waketime`). Else it is `stopped`: macOS
can turn off the background item in System Settings › General › Login Items & Extensions, or
`launchctl bootstrap` can fail. A stopped service does not count as installed for the `battery`
mode.

At its start in a mode other than `battery`, the app removes the grant files that an earlier run
left.

**Restore normal sleep** in Settings runs the remove script. It works also when the service is not
installed: it stops the service, runs `pmset -a disablesleep 0`, and removes the files. Settings
shows a red warning with this button when `ioreg` shows `SleepDisabled = Yes` and the app has no
fresh grant from an installed service that runs. The app also shows a desktop notification one
time for each such period, because the warning shows only while Settings is open.

The service cannot prove that the request comes from the app. Any process of the same user can renew
the grant, and any process can take the path of the app as its name (`exec -a`). The app bundle also
belongs to the user. So the service does not trust the app: its own limits are the safety rules. With
a grant that another process renews, the Mac stays on only within the battery floor (never below 20
percent), the thermal check and 8 hours on battery with the lid closed. Remove the service when the
mode is not in use.

## Routines in dark wake

When the lid closes, macOS tells apps that the system "will sleep" at the change from full wake to
dark wake (`IOPMrootDomain.cpp`, "Legacy apps were already told in the full->dark transition").
Chromium sends this as the `suspend` event. `LidAwakeRoutines` (`lid-awake-routines.ts`) holds the
routines on `suspend`, as for every sleep. While `LidAwakeService.holdsThroughLidClose` is true, it
starts the routines again 30 seconds later (they wait for the network first, as after a wake) only
when all of these are true:

- A chain of 5-second timers came on time, so the app ran all the time.
- `sysctl -n kern.sleeptime` shows no sleep after `suspend`. The kernel writes this time each time
  the Mac goes to sleep (`IOPMrootDomain::powerChangeDone`, `SLEEP_STATE`).
- A new read of the computer (`LidAwakeService.refresh`) shows that the mode keeps the Mac on.

Node timers and `process.hrtime` count the time in sleep: on macOS, libuv reads
`mach_continuous_time`. So a timer can come in a short maintenance wake after a real sleep, and a
clock difference cannot show the sleep. The first two checks find that case. At a real wake,
`resume` starts the routines as before. The local server process does not do this: its routines
stay held until the lid opens.

When the hold ends while the lid stays closed, for example because the power adapter is removed in
the `plugged` mode, macOS goes from dark wake to sleep and sends no new `suspend` event.
`LidAwakeRoutines.holdMayEnd` holds the routines again at `on-battery` and at each status change
that ends the hold; when the hold continues (the `battery` mode), the 30-second check starts them
again. macOS can sleep before the app reads the change, so a routine that is due in that moment can
still wait for the next wake. This is not verified on a device.

The display, the GPU and window capture are off in dark wake. Work that needs a window or the
screen, such as screen sharing, can stop with the lid closed. This is not verified.

## Test with the lid closed

**Test with the lid closed** in Settings records the wall clock, `kern.sleeptime` and the lid state
each 5 seconds, for up to 10 minutes. The time between two records counts as sleep when the kernel
recorded a sleep after the first record, or when the gap is longer than 15 seconds (the app did not
run). The result is "stayed on" only when the lid was closed for 2 minutes or more and no time
counts as sleep. A short maintenance wake can record one sample with the lid closed, so a sample
alone is not a pass. The last result is in `userData/lid-awake-test.json`, and `logs/main/main.log`
has one line for it.

To check by hand: `pmset -g log | grep -E "Clamshell|DarkWake|Wake from" | tail`.

## Checks

`bun scripts/lid-awake-smoke.ts` checks the decisions, the parsers, the command arguments and the
service script with stub commands. On the power adapter it also starts the `plugged` assertion for
a test process, reads `pmset -g assertions`, ends the process and checks that the assertion is gone.
It never runs `pmset` with `-a` and never makes the Mac sleep. It writes
`.buildersbot-build/lid-awake-smoke.json`.
