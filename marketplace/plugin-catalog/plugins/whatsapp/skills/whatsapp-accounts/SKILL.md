# WhatsApp accounts

wazap can hold several WhatsApp accounts. Each account is one phone number, with an id (such as
`empresa`) and a nickname (such as "Empresa" or "WhatsApp da Sofia").

## Pick the account

1. Call `get_status` first. Its `accounts` list gives each id, nickname, state and default.
2. Match the nickname that the user says ("o WhatsApp do Ariel", "o da empresa", "o da Sofia") to an
   account, and pass its `account_id` to every tool call.
3. With one account, use it. With two or more accounts and no clear nickname, ask which account.
   Never guess.
4. An account that is not linked or is turned off cannot read or send. Say so, and say how to fix it.

## Numbers

- Never invent, assume or reuse a phone number. A number in an example, a test or another chat is
  not the user's number. Ask the user for it.
- A number is in E.164: `+`, the country code, then the number, with no spaces (for example
  `+15550100` in a test). Without a country code, ask for the country.

## Add or link an account

- No wazap tool creates an account. `get_status`, `link_account` and the chat tools only use the
  accounts that exist.
- Prefer the plugin page: Marketplace › Apps › WhatsApp. Its accounts panel adds an account with a
  nickname and links it with a pairing code or a QR code. Send the user there.
- Only when you run commands on the computer of this server, and the user types a number in the
  chat and asks you to connect it:
  1. Normalize the number to E.164, and read it back to the user.
  2. Create a new account for it, with the nickname that the user gives:
     `npx -y wazap-mcp@1.6.0 account add <id> '--name=<nickname>'`. The id is lowercase letters,
     digits and dashes. Do not use braces or square brackets in the nickname. One number is one
     account.
  3. Call `link_account` with that `account_id` and the number. Show the 8-character code and the
     steps: WhatsApp › Settings › Linked devices › Link a device › Link with phone number instead.
     The code lasts two minutes.
  4. Call `get_status` every 10 seconds until the account is connected.
- Always pass `account_id` to `link_account`. Without it, wazap picks the default account.
- Call `link_account` only for an account that you created for that number in this conversation.
  Never call it for an account that existed before, linked or not: after an unlink, the account
  keeps the history of its number, and `get_status` does not show whose history it is. A different
  number makes wazap set that history aside and delete it after seven days.
- Connect only numbers that the user owns, or whose owner agrees.

## Send

- Every send is a draft first: `send_message` returns a preview, and `confirm_send` sends it only
  after the user approves that draft.
- An account in read only cannot send. Do not look for another way.
- Writes are limited to 20 a minute for each account. Do not send in bulk.
