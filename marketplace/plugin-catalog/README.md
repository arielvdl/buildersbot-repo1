# Plugin catalog source

For a worked example and the sign-in on a joined server, read
[Integrations and sign-in](../../docs/architecture/integrations.md#add-an-application).

One developer bundle per directory: `plugins/<slug>/plugin.json`.
`catalog.json` sets the order and the featured flags.
`scripts/build-plugin-catalog.ts` validates the source and writes three
generated outputs; never edit those by hand:

- `src/renderer/src/features/settings/marketplace-plugin-catalog.ts` (Apps tab)
- `apps/auth-api/src/lib/plugin-catalog.generated.ts` (Worker JSON routes)
- `resources/plugin-catalog/` (offline snapshot shipped with the app)

```sh
bun run marketplace:build:plugins
bun run marketplace:build:plugins -- --check
```

Rules for a new entry:

- One app per plugin. Skills stay `[]` until pinned skill versions exist.
- No secret values anywhere in this directory. Auth declares where a
  credential goes (`header` for http, `env` for stdio); the user types the
  value in the connect dialog.
- `http` servers take a `url`. `stdio` servers take a `command` and `args`.
  No `workingDirectory`: the provider drops such servers.
- A `command` can start with `~/` to name a program that a desktop app installs
  in the home folder, as the Paper listing does. Builders Bot expands `~` on the
  computer that runs the server, before any provider starts it.
- Names must pass `mcpConfigErrors` and must not be reserved (`buildersbot`).
- OAuth-only vendors install as a plain `http` server with a `link` flow, the
  same shape the Canva listing uses. Builders Bot signs in itself: the main process
  holds the MCP OAuth client, keeps the tokens in encrypted storage, and adds
  the `Authorization` header at hand-off. No bridge program is installed, and
  no listing may name one.

## Paper

Paper Desktop installs its CLI at `~/.paper/bin/paper`. `paper mcp` is a stdio
relay to the file that is open in Paper Desktop. Paper also has an http address,
`http://127.0.0.1:29979/mcp`, but its documentation calls that address legacy,
and a listing must use https. The listing needs no key.

Troubleshooting:

- "Command not found: ~/.paper/bin/paper": install Paper Desktop from
  <https://paper.design/downloads> and open it once.
- The tools see no file, or the wrong file: open the file in Paper Desktop.
  The server works on the file that is open.
- A long session calls tools that do not exist: start a new thread. Paper
  gives this advice in <https://paper.design/docs/mcp>.

## Obsidian

The listing runs `npx -y obsidian-mcp-server@3.7.2`
(<https://github.com/cyanheads/obsidian-mcp-server>). A third party publishes
this package and it gets write access to the vault, so the listing names one
version. Move it only in a reviewed commit, after you check that the release
keeps `OBSIDIAN_API_KEY` and the `http://127.0.0.1:27123` default. The server talks to the
Local REST API community plugin in the Obsidian app
(<https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api>). The user types the
plugin's API key in the connect dialog, and Builders Bot gives it to the server as
`OBSIDIAN_API_KEY`.

The server uses `http://127.0.0.1:27123` by default. A listing cannot set other
environment values, so the user turns on the plugin's HTTP server:

1. In Obsidian, install and enable the Local REST API plugin (version 4 or later).
2. Open Settings > Local REST API. Copy the API key.
3. Turn on "Enable non-encrypted (HTTP) server". Keep the port at 27123.
4. Keep Obsidian open while agents use the vault.

Troubleshooting:

- The connection is refused: Obsidian is closed, or the HTTP server is off.
- The server replies 401: the API key is wrong. Copy it again from the plugin settings.

## Apple apps

The listing starts the community server `mcp-icloud`
(<https://github.com/MrGo2/icloud-mcp>, MIT) through `npx`. The version is
pinned because the server can read and send mail and iMessages. To update it,
review the upstream changes, change the version in `args`, and increase the
listing `version`. The server has no read-only mode and no setting that limits
it to some apps.

The listing uses local mode only: the server controls the apps on this Mac
through AppleScript and needs no key. Its cloud mode needs
`USE_LOCAL_MODE=false`, and a listing cannot set a fixed environment value.

The app lists `macAutomation`: the Apple apps that the server drives. On a Mac
that runs the server, the listing page shows a switch, on by default, that asks
macOS for each app right after the install, and later an "Ask for access"
button. Builders Bot sends one harmless Apple Event (`count windows`) to each app, so
macOS shows its Automation prompt then and not during an agent's task. An app
that the request opened is quit again. macOS does not ask again for an app that
the user refused.

Troubleshooting:

- An error `-1743` ("not authorized to send Apple events"): the user refused
  the Automation prompt. Turn Builders Bot on for the app in System Settings ›
  Privacy & Security › Automation, or run `tccutil reset AppleEvents` to get
  the prompts again.
- Mail or Calendar tools time out: AppleScript is slow on large mailboxes and
  on many subscribed calendars. Ask for one folder and a smaller count.

## WhatsApp

The listing starts the community server `wazap-mcp`
(<https://github.com/razvangirgiz/wazap>, MIT) through `npx`. It is not the
official WhatsApp Business Cloud API: the server links the account as a device,
the way WhatsApp Web does, over Baileys, so it needs no Meta app, no business
account and no API key. The version is pinned because the server reads and sends
messages; to update it, review the upstream release, change the version in
`args`, and increase the listing `version`.

One wazap data folder holds several accounts, one number each, with an id and a
nickname. When the plugin is installed, its page has an accounts panel: it adds an
account with a nickname and a number, links it with a pairing code (default) or a
QR code, and turns accounts on and off, sets the default, sets read only, unlinks
and removes them. Main runs the same pinned CLI for this; see
[WhatsApp accounts](../../docs/architecture/whatsapp-accounts.md). No wazap tool
creates an account. An agent can still link from a chat, but only an account that
it created for that number in the same conversation: `link_account` takes an
`account_id` and the number in E.164 and returns an 8-character code. The user
types it in WhatsApp › Settings › Linked devices › Link a device › Link with phone
number instead. The code lasts two minutes. One number is one account: never link
a second number into an account that had another number or that keeps its history
after an unlink, because wazap then deletes the earlier history after seven days. The agent rules are in `plugins/whatsapp/skills/whatsapp-accounts/SKILL.md`;
the listing keeps `skills: []` until pinned skill versions exist, and the
developer instructions carry the same rules meanwhile.

The account, its history, credentials and kept media live in `~/.wazap`, on the
computer that runs the server. The stdio session lasts as long as the agent
session that started it; `npx wazap-mcp service install` keeps a server up on
`127.0.0.1:8766` between sessions. Agents draft and then send: `send_message`
returns a preview and `confirm_send` only sends after the user approves it.

Troubleshooting:

- "Command not found: npx": install Node.js 22.16+ or 24+.
- The code is refused: it expired or the number has no country code. Call
  `link_account` again with the full number.
- The link drops repeatedly: run `npx wazap-mcp status`; it prints the fix.
