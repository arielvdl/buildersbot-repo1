/**
 * The one place that knows what a signed-in web session is.
 *
 * The web app is being moved to the login of Cultura Builder, and that login will not be the account
 * login of Builders Bot. Everything else here is written against this module instead of the cookie, so the
 * swap touches this file and the routes keep working:
 *
 * - `webSessionToken` reads the session of the request, whatever carries it.
 * - `webSessionHash` names that session for anything stored beside it (a push subscription, a remote
 *   session). It must stay a hash of the secret, never the secret itself.
 * - `webClientIdentity` reads the installation that the client names. It is a label, not a proof.
 * - `webSessionCookie` writes the cookie, or clears it, for a sign-in and a sign-out.
 *
 * What a replacement must keep: the session is per installation, a revocation can be seen by a
 * trigger on the session row, and the hash of a session is stable for as long as it lives.
