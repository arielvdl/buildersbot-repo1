 * Tells the installed web app of a session that something happened, after the host already reached the

 *
 * The push is short on purpose: the browser has no seal for the notification text, so the message says
 * that there is activity and the app reads the detail over WebRTC when it opens. A subscription the
 * push service no longer accepts is dropped here, which is the only cleanup a browser needs.
 *
 * A failure of one push never fails the host request that caused it: the phone app was already served.
