/**
 * The face each agent wears, from the signals that can claim one.
 *
 * Pure and outside every context, for the same reason `computeSidebarAgentStates` is: the inputs
 * come from agents, turns and conversation at once, so a context that read all three would have to
 * sit under all three. It is the sibling of that function and shares its working test, so a row's
 * badge and the face above it can never disagree.
 *
 * The precedence is the point. It runs from the state that needs a person soonest to the state
 * that needs one least: a failed turn has already stopped, so it outranks a question that is still
 * waiting to be asked, which outranks work that is running on its own, which outranks a reply
 * nobody has read yet. Reading it the other way round would hide a failure behind the running turn
 * that produced it.
 *
 * An agent with nothing to say gets no entry, so the result is sparse and a missing key means
 * `idle` rather than "unknown". `connecting` and `asleep` are not derived here: they belong to the
 * surface around the avatar rather than to the agent, so their callers pass them in.
