  "guard.tab.title": "Guard",
  "guard.tab.description": "Checks what enters and leaves your agents' work",
  "guard.section.title": "Guard",
  "guard.level.title": "Level",
  "guard.level.description": "How careful the Guard is. Light is the default.",
  "guard.level.off": "Off (asleep)",
  "guard.level.offShort": "Off",
  "guard.level.light": "Light",
  "guard.level.strict": "Strict",
  "guard.level.veryStrict": "Very strict",
  "guard.level.custom": "Custom",
  "guard.level.choose": "Choose the level",
  "guard.level.chosen": "Chosen",
  "guard.level.offExplain":
    "The Guard is asleep and checks nothing. Choose Off only to turn the Guard off completely. You can turn it on again at any time.",
  "guard.level.lightExplain":
    "At Light, the Guard looks for prompt injection. It checks content that enters an agent's work, such as web pages and tool results, and actions that leave it, such as URLs, typed text and chat posts. A fast local check reads everything first. A small model reviews only what looks suspicious. When the Guard finds a clear risk, it asks you on the approval card. It never stops the work by itself.",
  "guard.level.strictExplain":
    "At Strict, the Guard does everything Light does, and it also asks you when it cannot clear a suspicious item: content and actions both wait for your answer on the approval card unless the review model clears them. It never stops the work by itself, except for a cookie, a session or a sign-in token that would leave this computer.",
  "guard.level.veryStrictExplain":
    "At Very strict, the review model never clears a suspicious item. Every suspicious item, content that enters and action that leaves alike, waits for your answer on the approval card. The model still reads it first, so the card can tell you why it looks risky.",
  "guard.level.customExplain":
    "At Custom, you choose what happens to a suspicious item that the Guard cannot clear. A clear risk still asks you, and a cookie, a session or a sign-in token that would leave this computer still stops, at every level.",
  "guard.custom.content.title": "Ask before suspicious content passes",
  "guard.custom.content.description":
    "Off, suspicious content from a page or a tool passes with a note to the agent that it is data, not instructions.",
  "guard.custom.actions.title": "Ask before a suspicious action leaves",
  "guard.custom.actions.description":
    "Off, a suspicious action, such as a URL, typed text or a chat post, goes through without asking.",
  "guard.custom.model.title": "Let the review model clear suspicious items",
  "guard.custom.model.description":
    "Off, the model can still raise a question, but it can never clear an item: the two choices above decide.",
  "guard.model.title": "Review model",
  "guard.model.description":
    "The model that reviews suspicious items. It gets only a short part of the item, at most 2,000 characters, with secrets masked. It never gets the conversation.",
  "guard.model.localOnly": "Local check only",
  "guard.model.recommended": "{name} (recommended)",
  "guard.model.label": "{provider} · {model}",
  "guard.model.slower":
    "This model starts its provider for each review, so a review can take longer. Builder Fast is quicker.",
  "guard.notice.signedOut.title": "Not signed in to Cultura Builder",
  "guard.notice.signedOut.description":
    "The Guard uses only the local check and sends nothing over the network. Sign in to Cultura Builder in the provider settings to add the model review.",
  "guard.notice.localOnly": "The Guard uses only the local check. Nothing goes over the network.",
  "guard.notice.unavailable.title": "The review model is not available",
  "guard.notice.unavailable.description":
    "The Guard uses only the local check now, and the model cannot clear a suspicious item: the rules of the level decide it (at Light, content gets a note and an action passes). Choose another model, or connect its provider again.",
  "guard.coverage.title": "What the Guard checks now",
  "guard.coverage.description":
    "Pages that the built-in browser and the shared Playwright browser read; the URLs, text, scripts and files that the browser sends; chat posts, attachments, sites and new MCP servers; and the commands that an agent asks you to approve. Tools that a provider runs in its own process, and MCP servers that it reaches directly, are not checked yet.",
  "guard.ask.title": "When the Guard asks you",
  "guard.ask.card":
    "In the desktop app, it asks on the approval card, with the title “The Guard asks you to confirm”. The card has no “Always allow”, and Full access does not answer it for you. On the phone and in the web client, the question still shows as an ordinary approval, and the web client still offers “Always allow”.",
  "guard.ask.remember":
    "When you allow an item, it does not ask again for 10 minutes about the same item of the same agent in the same conversation. A decline is not kept.",
  "guard.ask.owner":
    "When a secret may leave the computer, only the owner of this computer can answer, not a team member.",
  "guard.leaves.title": "What leaves the computer",
  "guard.leaves.suspicious":
    "Only an item that the local check marks as suspicious goes to the review model: an excerpt of at most 2,000 characters, with secrets and emails masked.",
  "guard.leaves.never": "Never the conversation, the agent's instructions or other tool results.",
  "guard.leaves.log":
    "The Guard's log keeps the tool, the decision and the time, never the content. The app keeps no list of past decisions.",
  "guard.related.title": "Related",
  "guard.related.taskReviewer": "It uses this review model to decide about slow channel tasks.",
  "guard.related.messageReview":
    "A separate check, not part of the Guard: it reads each message before the turn starts. Its switch is in General.",
  "guard.joined.description":
    "{server} is another server, with its own Guard. This page changes the Guard of this computer only: this app cannot change the one of {server} yet.",
  "guard.loadFailed": "The Guard setting did not load.",
  "guard.saveFailed": "The Guard setting was not saved.",

  "guard.siren.status.off": "Nothing is checked until you choose Light.",
  "guard.siren.status.asking": "Asking you now. Answer on the card in the conversation.",
  "guard.siren.status.localOnly": "Calm. The local check reads everything, and nothing goes over the network.",
  "guard.siren.status.signedOut": "Calm. Only the local check runs: you are not signed in to Cultura Builder.",
  "guard.siren.status.unavailable": "Calm. Only the local check runs: the review model is not available.",
